# T847 experimental setup repository

This repository is meant to persist configuration items and steps to fulfill experimental setups defined in the course of the T847 professional project.

The experiments explore numerous capabilities of security solution providers:

- U1: identification of vulnerable packages in a container image
- U3: identification of malicious behaviour in a running container
- U6: intentional resource consumption of a container to starve its host resources

The experiments are conducted on [KinD](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind), where the overall installation procedure is shown in [kind-installation](kind-installation).
